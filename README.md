# OthersideFabric
A Minecraft fabric mod. This mod prevents mobs from despawning after going through a nether portal for a certain period (by default 60 seconds) in order to mimic single-player behaviour. This fixies many mob farms using nether portals on multi-player servers.
This mod was inspired by a paper plugin called [Otherside](https://hangar.papermc.io/Kyle/Otherside) by Kyle.

## Usage and configuration
This mod can be configured by editing the `otherside.properties` file. This mod does not (yet) support different despawn timers for different mobs.
You can check if this mod is running with `/otherside` and you can reload the config using `/otherside reload` (requires level 4 permission).
