# OthersideFabric
A Minecraft fabric mod. This mod prevents mobs from despawning after going through a nether portal for a certain period (by default 60 seconds) in order to mimic single-player behaviour. This fixies many mob farms using nether portals on multi-player servers.
 
This mod was inspired by a paper plugin called [Otherside](https://hangar.papermc.io/Kyle/Otherside) by Kyle.
